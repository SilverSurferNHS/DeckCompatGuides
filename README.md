Bear with me as i learn to use github, as i try to find the best way to track all this. The following is my initial commit of Steam Deck compatibility commands and compatabilty strategies.
For now, search for your game with ctrl+f, then copy the command to your Launch command in the game properties window from Steam. It's best to do this from Desktop mode.
Make sure you download the applicable package for said game, be it dgvoodoo, or a compatibility hook, then extract it, usually to where the game's executable resides.
For dgvoodoo, be sure to customize the config file to your liking. I have some sample files to reference that work for most games and will have game specific ones added over time.

I think it'll be easiest to maintain this collection in a spreadsheet. I'll be updating this page and the local spreadsheet soon and might host it on gdocks as well.
